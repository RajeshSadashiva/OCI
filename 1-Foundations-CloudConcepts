Cloud Concepts:
	1) Cloud Computing
		1) On-Demand Self Service: On-Demand resource provisioning capabilities.
		2) Broad network access: Resources can be triggered via internet.
		3) Resource pooling: Resources are pooled for multiple consumers using multi-tenet model.
		4) Rapid elasticity: Resources can be scaled.
		5) Measured service: Resources can be monitored for performance, security and cost.
		
	2) Service Models
		1) Traditional IT/On-Premise: All the resources are self-managed.
		2) IAAS: Networking, storage, servers and virtualization is managed by Cloud provider.
		3) PAAS: Runtime + OS + middleware + IAAS managed by Cloud provider.
		4) SAAS: Software as a service, pay for services.
		
	3) Cloud Terminology
		1) High Availability: High availability systems avoid any single point of failure.
		2) Disaster Recovery: 
			ยง Recovery Point Objective: Time threshold for data loss. Example 1hr of data loss during a Disaster is ok.
			ยง Recovery Time Objective: Time threshold for resuming the services. Example, in 15min the services should resume.
		3) Fault Tolerance: Describes how a Cloud vendor will ensure minimal downtime for services provided. 
		4) Scalability: 
			ยง Horizontal Scaling: Scale in/Scale out resources based on the requirement. Ex, add or remove more servers.
			ยง Vertical Scaling: Scale up/Scale down resources based on the requirement. Ex, increase or decrease CPU and memory of the server.
		5) Elasticity: Ability to quickly scale. 
		
	4) CAPEX vs OPEX: Cloud lets you trade CAPEX for OPEX.
		CAPEX: Capital expenditure of the resources. Fixed assets like buildings, equipment for servers etc.
		OPEX: Operational expenditure for running the servers.
