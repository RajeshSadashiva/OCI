	1) Virtual Cloud Network
		▪ Software defined private network
		▪ Enables OCI resources to communicate within OCI and on premise.
		▪ Highly Available, Scalable and Secure. 
		▪ Address range is the IP range of VCN
		▪ Every resource in OCI has a unique private IP
		▪ Subnets further divide the VCN
		▪ Subnets further isolate and secure the VCN
		▪ Compute instances are placed inside a subnet.
		
	2) Gateways
		▪ Internet Gateway provides a pathway from internet to OCI, ex: Users accessing website.
		▪ NAT Gateway provides a pathway from OCI to internet, ex: Patches, updates.
		▪ DRG(Dynamic Routing Gateway):
			§ A tool to connect OCI and On-premise resources. 
			§ IPSec VPN:  A VPN based Routing Gateway
			§ FastConnect: Private, Dedicated Connectivity.
		▪ Service Gateway: Lets you access the Public OCI services such as Object storage without using an Internet or NAT Gateway. Uses private IP of the services to communicate inside OCI.
	3) Peering
		▪ VCN Peering is a process of connecting multiple VCNs.
		▪ Local VCN peering: is a process of connecting VCNs within the same region.
		▪ Remote VCN peering: is a process of connecting VCNs in different regions.
	4) VCN Security
		▪ Security list consists of a set of rules associated with a subnet that specifies traffic allowed in and out of subnet.
		▪ Network security Group consists of a set of rules that apply only to a set of VNICs.
	5) Load Balancer
		▪ A load balancer sits between the clients and the servers
		▪ Below are the activities of an LB.
			§ Service Discovery: What backend servers are available. 
			§ Health Check of backend servers.
			§ Which algorithm to be used to balance the load on the backend servers.
		▪ Benefits of an LB.
			§ Fault tolerant and Highly available
			§ Scale
			§ Naming abstraction: name resolution can be delegated to the LD and backend servers don't need public IP.
    Public Load balancer: Public IP for load balancers which are present in public subnet and they load balance the servers which are present in private subnet.
