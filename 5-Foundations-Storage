	1) Block volume
		▪ Hard-drive equivalent, stores beyond lifetime of compute instances
		▪ No high level metadata 
		▪ Can mount to any kind of File system
		▪ Periodic backups recommended with OCI allowed automated scheduled backups to object storage.
		▪ Boot volume - OS disk
		▪ Block volume - Data disk
	2) Local NVMe
		▪ Designed high performance local storage
		▪ NoSQL databases, DWH, in-memory DBs
		▪ Storage is non-persistent.
		▪ No support of snapshots, backups.
	3) File Storage
		▪ NFS equivalent - NFSv3
		▪ Hierarchical 
		▪ Access over network without additional software
		▪ Restore a file within snapshot or entire snapshot using cp, rsync command
	4) Object Storage
		▪ No hierarchy - flat structure 
		▪ Metadata - index based
		▪ Internet scale, high performance
		▪ Optional - multi AD region backup
		▪ Cross region copy for DR scenarios
	5) Archive Storage
		▪ Same as Object storage but the retrieval rate is slow.
		▪ 10times cheaper that standard 
		▪ 90 days minimum retention period.
		▪ Archive bucket can't be upgraded to standard storage tier or vice versa
