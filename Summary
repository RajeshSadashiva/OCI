Cloud Concepts:
	1) Cloud Computing
		1) On-Demand Self Service: On-Demand resource provisioning capabilities.
		2) Broad network access: Resources can be triggered via internet.
		3) Resource pooling: Resources are pooled for multiple consumers using multi-tenet model.
		4) Rapid elasticity: Resources can be scaled.
		5) Measured service: Resources can be monitored for performance, security and cost.
		
	2) Service Models
		1) Traditional IT/On-Premise: All the resources are self-managed.
		2) IAAS: Networking, storage, servers and virtualization is managed by Cloud provider.
		3) PAAS: Runtime + OS + middleware + IAAS managed by Cloud provider.
		4) SAAS: Software as a service, pay for services.
		
	3) Cloud Terminology
		1) High Availability: High availability systems avoid any single point of failure.
		2) Disaster Recovery: 
			§ Recovery Point Objective: Time threshold for data loss. Example 1hr of data loss during a Disaster is ok.
			§ Recovery Time Objective: Time threshold for resuming the services. Example, in 15min the services should resume.
		3) Fault Tolerance: Describes how a Cloud vendor will ensure minimal downtime for services provided. 
		4) Scalability: 
			§ Horizontal Scaling: Scale in/Scale out resources based on the requirement. Ex, add or remove more servers.
			§ Vertical Scaling: Scale up/Scale down resources based on the requirement. Ex, increase or decrease CPU and memory of the server.
		5) Elasticity: Ability to quickly scale. 
		
	4) CAPEX vs OPEX: Cloud lets you trade CAPEX for OPEX.
		CAPEX: Capital expenditure of the resources. Fixed assets like buildings, equipment for servers etc.
		OPEX: Operational expenditure for running the servers. 
		
		
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architecture
	1) Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Regions
		▪ A Region is the geographical area comprising of one or more data center(Availability Domains)
		▪ As of Feb 2020 there are 21 Regions and 15 planned regions. Here is the link for the regions in the Oracle Cloud and the services available https://www.oracle.com/cloud/data-regions.html
		▪ We have to choose a region close to customers, so that there is low-latency. 
		▪ We have to choose the region based on the data compliance imposed by countries. 
	2) Availability Domain
		▪ Availability Domain is an isolated data center located in a region.
		▪ There can be 1 or more Availability Domains in a region and are very unlikely to fail simultaneously.
		▪ Availability Domains don’t share the physical infrastructure such as power, cooling or domain network.
		▪ All Availability Domains in a region are connected via low-latency, high network bandwidth.
	3) Fault Domains
		▪ Grouping of infrastructure within an Availability Domain to provide a fault tolerant environment.
		▪ FDs act as logical data center within an AD.
		▪ Each AD has 3 FDs and they don't share a single point failure. 
		▪ Placement of resources can be configured during the launch time.
	4) High Availability Design
		▪ We can use combination of fault domains, Availability Domains and Regions to make a high available solution
		▪ Using multiple FDs in AD, for example FD1 - 1 web, FD2 - 1 DB, FD3 - 2 web, 2 DB. This way if one FD fails still the system is available. 
		▪ Deploy Systems in multiple AD to protect from a single AD failure.
		▪ Region Pair to protect from a Region failure. 
	5) Compartments
		▪ A compartment is a collection of related resources. It helps you to isolate and control access to your resources
		▪ Tenancy or Root compartment is the first and default compartment, inside which multiple compartments can be configured. 
		▪ Compartments can be nested till 6 levels deep.
		▪ Each resource belongs to a single compartment.
		▪ Resources can interact with other compartments.
		▪ Resources can be moved, added and deleted anytime.
		▪ Resources from multiple regions can be placed in a single compartment. 
		▪ Users can access compartments by policies. 
		▪ Analyze costs at compartment level.
	
Oracle Cloud Networking Services
	1) Virtual Cloud Network
		▪ Software defined private network
		▪ Enables OCI resources to communicate within OCI and on premise.
		▪ Highly Available, Scalable and Secure. 
		▪ Address range is the IP range of VCN
		▪ Every resource in OCI has a unique private IP
		▪ Subnets further divide the VCN
		▪ Subnets further isolate and secure the VCN
		▪ Compute instances are placed inside a subnet.
		
	2) Gateways
		▪ Internet Gateway provides a pathway from internet to OCI, ex: Users accessing website.
		▪ NAT Gateway provides a pathway from OCI to internet, ex: Patches, updates.
		▪ DRG(Dynamic Routing Gateway):
			§ A tool to connect OCI and On-premise resources. 
			§ IPSec VPN:  A VPN based Routing Gateway
			§ FastConnect: Private, Dedicated Connectivity.
		▪ Service Gateway: Lets you access the Public OCI services such as Object storage without using an Internet or NAT Gateway. Uses private IP of the services to communicate inside OCI.
	3) Peering
		▪ VCN Peering is a process of connecting multiple VCNs.
		▪ Local VCN peering: is a process of connecting VCNs within the same region.
		▪ Remote VCN peering: is a process of connecting VCNs in different regions.
	4) VCN Security
		▪ Security list consists of a set of rules associated with a subnet that specifies traffic allowed in and out of subnet.
		▪ Network security Group consists of a set of rules that apply only to a set of VNICs.
	5) Load Balancer
		▪ A load balancer sits between the clients and the servers
		▪ Below are the activities of an LB.
			§ Service Discovery: What backend servers are available. 
			§ Health Check of backend servers.
			§ Which algorithm to be used to balance the load on the backend servers.
		▪ Benefits of an LB.
			§ Fault tolerant and Highly available
			§ Scale
			§ Naming abstraction: name resolution can be delegated to the LD and backend servers don't need public IP.
		▪ Public Load balancer: Public IP for load balancers which are present in public subnet and they load balance the servers which are present in private subnet.

Compute Services: 
	1) Bare metal
		§ Direct hardware access, single tenant
		§ Workloads that are performance sensitive
		§ Workloads that are not virtualized. 
		§ Workloads that require special hypervisor. 
		§ Workloads that require bring your own license. 
	2) VMs
		§ VM - A hypervisor underlying bare metal servers intro smaller VMs optimized for hardware, firmware and network infrastructure. Multi-tenant.
			§ When a control of full aspects for VM required. 
			§ Running legacy Linux and windows
			§ On-premise to OCI
		§ Dedicated VM host(DVH) - VM single-tenant. Pay for only dedicated VM host - no charge for running VMs on the Dedicated VM. Oracle manages hypervisor and hardware.
	3) Scaling
		§ Horizontal Scaling: Scale in/Scale out resources based on the requirement. New shapes must have the same. Auto-scaling is a feature to automatically detect the load to add or remove servers. No additional cost for using auto-scaling feature, pay as per compute instances used.
		§ Vertical Scaling: Scale up/Scale down resources based on the requirement. Ex, increase or decrease CPU and memory of the server.
	4) Container Engine
		▪ Containers share the Kernel OS with other containers and are hosted on VMs
		▪ Containers are not tied to any specific infrastructure and can run anywhere.
		▪ How to run? Manually SSH into machines and run Docker.
		▪ Pros: Simple and easy to run.
		▪ Cons: Not scalable, no self-healing, no automation and not reproducible. 
		▪ To handle the cons we need to use orchestration tools like docker swarm and kubernetes engine
		▪ Oracle Kubernetes Engine(OKE) uses open source system Kubernetes for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. 
		▪ OCIR is a managed docker container registry service and can be used to pull images for deployments. 
	5) Functions
		▪ Small but powerful blocks of code that generally do one simple thing. 
		▪ Stored as docker image in a specified Docker registry
		▪ Invoked in response to a CLI command or Signed HTTP request. 

Pricing and Billing
